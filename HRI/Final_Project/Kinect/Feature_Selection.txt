Joint Positions:
The 3D coordinates (x, y, z) of each joint (e.g., head, shoulders, elbows, wrists) can be used as features.


Joint Velocities:
The rate of change of joint positions over time can capture movement patterns.

Get timestamp 1 and timestamp 2, subtract
distance subtraction .... distance/time

Joint Angles:
The angle between connected joints (e.g., elbow angle) can represent the posture and movement of the body.

I'm working right now with data from a motion capture device, essentially picking up data for three markers placed on the head neck and shoulder in an x y z plane.
My difficulty trying to develop a code to calculate the joint angles between these three markers. I am able to animate the three coordinates to play as an animation, but I'm more interested in the calculation of the angles between these points changing over time.
Any ideas on how to go about this?
 h = atan2(norm(cross(N-H,S-H)),dot(N-H,S-H));
 n = atan2(norm(cross(S-N,H-N)),dot(S-N,H-N));
 s = atan2(norm(cross(H-S,N-S)),dot(H-S,N-S));


Joint Angular Velocities:
The rate of change of joint angles over time provides information about the speed and direction of movement.

sub joint angle 1, joint angle 2 / sub time 1 timestamp 2


Spatial Relationships:
Distances and angles between different joints can be used to characterize the overall posture and movement.
